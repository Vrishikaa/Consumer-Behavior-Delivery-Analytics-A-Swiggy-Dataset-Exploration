   - Demand for healthy food options is gradually increasing.  

3. **Sales Trends**  
   - Peak order times are **lunch (12‚Äì2 PM)** and **dinner (7‚Äì10 PM)**.  
   - Weekend orders are 20‚Äì25% higher compared to weekdays.  

4. **External Factors**  
   - Fuel price fluctuations indirectly impact delivery costs and margins.  
   - Temperature bands correlate with demand (e.g., cold beverages in summer, soups in winter).
